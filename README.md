# Utilizing-statistical-methods-to-discover-genetic-variants-in-Brain-Disorders

Most current association studies focus on a single biological unit. In our work, we developed an Image Expression
Directed Linear Mixed Model (IEDLMM) which utilizes informative weights learned from training
genetically predictive models for brain images using a linear mixed model and for gene expressions
using a Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model, to estimate the polygenic term in a linear mixed
model. Through Simulations we have proven that, IEDLMM exhibits higher power than current
methods while keeping the type-I error rates under control. By leveraging the UK Biobank imagederived
phenotypes (IDPs) and GTEx gene expression data, the IEDLMM identified 15 unique genes
related to brain disorders across four datasets which are validated through DisGeNET functional
annotations proving the efficacy of IEDLMM compared to existing methods. The creation of
IEDLMM paves the way for additional exploration in the integration of multiple omics data within
a single framework. This method not only improves the credibitility of the results but also furthers
our knowledge in the field, laying a foundation for future research efforts.
